        "section1content": "<p>Unitarians are people who follow Unitarianism, a non-conforming religion that branches off from Christianity. Historically, Unitarians are Christians who believed in the Unity of God, a counter viewpoint from the Christian’s belief in Trinity of God. Unitarianism has developed itself independently in many countries during the same period, facing the same oppression and opposition from the mainstream churches. Over time, Unitarianism developed itself into a stand-alone belief that encourages religious freedom and individual quest for truth. The Unitarians in the USA merged with Universalists to become Unitarian Universalist Association, the largest group of Unitarian communities.</p><p>Apart from a few common beliefs, there are not really a list of things Unitarians must believe in or must do. Despite its Christian heritage, many Unitarians nowadays do not call themselves Christians at all; while some still do. There are also Unitarians of various other backgrounds, including Buddhists, Muslims, Jewish, Baha’i, Hindus, Humanist, Pagan, or even Atheists.</p>",
