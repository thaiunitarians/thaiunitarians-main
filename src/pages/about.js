                Unitarianism encourages the individual quest for truth and religious freedom, equality and rational thought. We particularly value different beliefs and lifestyles, different cultures and ideas, and against any forms of discrimination including gender, age, race, religion, and sexual orientation. We value insights and teaching from all sources including the holy writings of any religions, scientific knowledge, arts, the natural world.

                <blockquote>
                    <p>In Unitarian Universalism, you can bring your whole self: your full identity, your questioning mind, your expansive heart.</p>
                    <p>Unitarian Universalists believe more than one thing. We think for ourselves, and reflect together, about important questions:</p>
